**PHASE 1 : JAVASCRIPT**

**INDIVIDUAL CODE CHALLENGE**

This repository contains three small-scale programs written in javascript.
Each of them is addressing diffrent issues and if you want to get to know how they work and how to execute the programs feel free
to read through this README file.

HOW TO DOWNLOAD THIS PROGRAM AND RUN IT ON YOUR MACHINE

1 . STUDENT GRADE GENERATOR USING JAVASCRIPT

This program prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below:

        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

~ HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
To run the program just open the Student Grade Generator html file and launch the live server and once you key in your marks
the corresponding marks will be displayed.

2. SPEED DETECTOR PROGRAM

This program takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it prints “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it gives the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

> For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

~ HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
To execute the program all you have to do is to open the SpeedDetector html file and launch the live server and once it has opened in the browser key in the required data and watch the magic unfold.

3. SALARY CALCULATOR

This programs major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculates the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary.

    ~HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
    For this it is diffrent from the others as you'll have to open the program in the SalaryCalculator.js file and once there you open the terminal and type node.js ./SalaryCalculator.js then press enter. Once in the node enviroment you can invoke the function by using this
    calculateSalary(basicSalary, benefits) and passing in the required parameters and watch the magic unfold.
